// because enums are treated as objects are runtime, need to use keyof typeof for enum
enum ColorsEnum {
    white = '#ffffff',
    black = '#000000',
}
//Here ColorsEnum exists as an object at runtime, not as a type. So, we need to invoke keyof typeof operators together as shown in the following code:

type Colors = keyof typeof ColorsEnum

let colorLiteral: Colors
colorLiteral = "white"  // OK
colorLiteral = "black"  // OK

//reverse mappings
enum Enum {
    A,
  }
   
  let a = Enum.A;
  let nameOfA = Enum[a]; // "A"

//enum is compiled into an object that stores both forward (name -> value) and reverse (value -> name) mappings
//Keep in mind that string enum members do not get a reverse mapping generated at all.


//const enums: To avoid paying the cost of extra generated code and additional indirection when accessing enum values, itâ€™s possible to use const enums.
